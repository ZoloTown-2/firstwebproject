  <!-- 
    The img tag displays images on a web page.
    
    Necessary attributes include:
      src, which states where the image can be found.
      alt, which gives descriptive text about the image itself.
        The goal with alt is to give enough description for a
        person with vision difficulties, but do not be overly
        descriptive.
    Useful attributes include:
      width: Lets you set the horizontal size of the image.
      height: Lets you set the vertical size of the image.
  -->
  <!-- 
    Also, img is an example of an inline element because an img
    only takes up as much space on the web page as it needs to
    for displaying properly.
  -->

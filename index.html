    <p>Hello, my name is Xander. This is my first website.</p>
    <p>I'm not quite sure what I'm aiming to do in this website, I just like to program things for fun, and finding this school has already made things much better for me.</p>
    <p>You can click around the website, you may find something you like.</p>
    <p>Above are your main navigation methods, I suggest you click up there when you're finished with a page.</p>
    <p>I personally haven't worked with HTML in a little while, so this is pretty fun getting to know it again. It is a great way (if not one of the only ways) to make a website by hand, and is a great talent to have in today's computerized world.</p>
    <p>I've helped a handful of people here with a lot of CSS, despite not using a whole lot in this webpage.</p>

      h1 is the largest type of heading and is the main 
      heading for a website.

      It is an example of a block element because it 
      spans the whole width of the website by default.

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <!-- 
      h2 is the second level of heading and is what is used

      a is short for anchor. It allows us to create links
      between web pages in our own website, links to external
      websites, links to email addresses, or links to telephone
      numbers.
      
      Necessary attributes include:
        href, which is the hyperlink reference or link that you
        are trying to create.
          href can have a vaue of a file name in your project, 
          an external web address (starting with http:// or https://),
          a mailto: followed by an email address, or tel: followed
          by a telephone number.
      Useful attributes include:
        target, which lets you set where in the web browser the
        link should be opened. E.g., _blank opens the link in a
        new tab.

    Neccessary attributes include:
      method, which defines how data that is put into the form
      is handled.
        There are two possible values:
          get, which displays all input at the end of the web address.
          (NOTE: NOT GOOD FOR PRIVATE INFORMATION!!!)
          post, which handles all input by seding it to a back-end
          program.
